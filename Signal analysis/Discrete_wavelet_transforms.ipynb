    "## Results\n",
    "- Wavelet types\n",
    "Orthogonal wavelets, such as Symlet and Daubechies wavelets, are often employed to denoise signals [1] [2] . Daubechies wavelets, also called compactly-supported orthonormal wavelets [3], have a nonlinear phase and concentrate their energy around the beginning of their support [4]. While Symlets are also known as Daubechies' least-asymmetric wavelets, they are modified Daubechies wavelets. Their phase is nearly linear [5]. \n",
    "We compared Daubechies and Symlets wavelets while holding the other parameters constant (wavelength 6, decomposition level 5).\n",
    "These are the [links to the denoised audio plot using Daubechies wavelets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1erDM_9f1NToU8BWasZoiZT3xpG-7kUez/view?usp=sharing), [and to the denoised audio plot using Symlet Wavelets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kl_oLl8Um7IrRhCO4phoDk3q93_SlKwn/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "Daubechies wavelets\n",
    "![Daubechies wavelets](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1erDM_9f1NToU8BWasZoiZT3xpG-7kUez)\n",
    "Symlets wavelets\n",
    "![Symlets wavelets](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kl_oLl8Um7IrRhCO4phoDk3q93_SlKwn)\n",
    "The Symlets wavelets were more effective in reducing humpback grunt while maintaining orca calls. This might be explained by Symlets having comparable time-varying characteristics to the denoised signal [6].\n",
    "- Wavelet length\n",
    "Wavelet length affects the fine-scale detail of the wavelet shape: longer wavelets are smoother. Wavelengths range from 2 to 20, however wavelengths between 2 and 6 have a greater effect on the result. This is due to the fact that variations in wavelet smoothness are more noticeable at shorter wavelet lengths than at longer wavelet lengths, as are their effects on wavelet coefficients. When we want the output to be less sensitive to sharp edges in the wavelet or minor perturbation, longer wavelengths are desirable [6]. Larger wavelengths, on the other hand, have the following limitations: the coefficients are more impacted by boundary conditions, the computing cost is higher, and the degree of localisation of the wavelet coefficients is reduced [6].\n",
    "We compared wavelets with lengths of 2, 6, and 20, while maintaining the wavelet type (Symlet) and level of decomposition (level 5) unchanged.\n",
    "These are the [links to the denoised audio plot using length 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12retQ3hgOtG0uo2E9gib3AjiayQpE__5/view?usp=sharing), [length 20](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gcgV87EfiJsks7SecsK5oXEuza5rcdcZ/view?usp=sharing) [and length 6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kl_oLl8Um7IrRhCO4phoDk3q93_SlKwn/view?usp=sharing) (same as above). \n",

    "![wavelength 6](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kl_oLl8Um7IrRhCO4phoDk3q93_SlKwn). \n",
    "The plots at wavelengths 2 and 20 produced similar results, although both reduced the intensity of the orca calls. Wavelength 6 was the best since it preserved the first orca calls while reducing humpback grunts.\n",
    "-Decomposition levels\n",
    "Levels of decomposition vary from 1 to the maximum decomposition level [7]. The maximum level of wavelet decomposition ($M$) is computed as  $M = {log_{2}N/(L-1)}$ , where $N$ is the signal length and $L$ is the filter length [8]. In our case, $M=16$.\n",
    "Moyang et al. investigated various decomposition levels for hydrological time series modelling and concluded that decomposition levels under 6 (using Daubechies wavelet with wavelength 3) generated the best results for them, regardless of decomposition method [7].\n",
    "Taking this into account, we compared wavelets with decomposition levels 1, 5, 10 and maximum level (16) while mantaining the other parameters unchanged (Symlets with wavelength 6).\n",
    "These are the [links to the denoised audio plot using level 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/143FDS-F_RYK4jyBVD-7hPtBt9A0BazV2/view?usp=sharing), [level 5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kl_oLl8Um7IrRhCO4phoDk3q93_SlKwn/view?usp=sharing) (same as above), [level 10](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LE-uBqs5tnuCep6hW_H9uYDeoTyJBzk9/view?usp=sharing),\n",

    "The denoised audio with decomposition level 1 was the worst because it also cancelled the majority of the orca calls. Decomposition levels 5, 10, and 16 provided comparable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we investigated whether changing the original signal would provide comparable outcomes. We utilised the one-minute audio clip using Symlets with wavelength 5 at three different decomposition levels (5, 10, and maximum level). In thi case, the maximum level is 17.\n",
    "These are the [links to the denoised audio plot using level 5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKuXzKEFFCzW9Wvpoh80NGk77aDscIbq/view?usp=sharing), [level 10](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LZ0WtHEA8OWRyFcA3dePcXYJToMqidYV/view?usp=sharing),\n",
