    "The single clip from the first set is an encounter between a humpback and Bigg's killer whales in the Salish sea[6]. Orcas call in the first 7 seconds of the recording, whereas humpbacks begin grunting for 12 seconds beginning at second 11. \n",

    "\n",
    "For the first set calculated the original and denoised signals' Welch's power spectral densities for each method. All signal lengths were normalised to be a power of two. In contrast to a large prime factor, scaling the signal size as a power of 2 makes it computationally quicker [8]. Here are the density plots of the single clip [with](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17jkQiZ7y_u9NWl85q0wrqDjtXeCYE89m/view?usp=sharing) and [without](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_0xELU8ucPvR9rSp3DHhpmeU09ip6sT/view?usp=sharing) rescaling.\n",

    "We used the binomial moving average, the moving average filter, and the median average filter to compare performances for the set of 5 clips. The median filter and the hampel filter were the two that performed the best in the single clip experiment, so we decided to use one of them for this set. However, for the collection of 5 clips, the binomial moving average and the moving average did the best audibly, therefore we selected these 2."

    "Both experiments have led me to the conclusion that the technique that worked best for a single clip was not the best for a set of five clips. We cannot select a single Fourier transform technique as the best due to the variation in noise levels among samples. In the next post we will analyse the performance of Discrete Wavelet Transforms for denoising."
