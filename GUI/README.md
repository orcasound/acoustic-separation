# GUI
## Graphic User Interface folder

## Description
In this folder we provide the Graphical User Interface to preprocess and separate the audio clips in stems.
GUI.py utilises Orca_background.png as a background image. It calls plots.py and transforms.py. 
Plots.py contains all the functions used to plot in the GUI and transforms.py contains all the preprocessing techniques.
Screencapture.mp4 contains a demo of the GUI
